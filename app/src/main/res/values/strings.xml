    <string name="learner">Hello, my name is Ikechukwu Iroka. I am an android developer
    who is currently learning Kotlin in other to improve my skill.
        \nKotlin is such a wonderful language to learn because it really gets reed of a lot of
    boilerplate in Java. I am really happy though that i learnt Java because its not so difficult
    understanding Kotlin since its OOP inclined. \nKotlin indeed is a modern language.
        The designers need to be praise for focusing their mind on readability.
        Normally, I should be looking for a book that explains Kotlin from the very basics.
    But I am not. All am doing is to read Kotlin code, if I see an unfamiliar syntax, I read it up.
        \nSuch a delight learning Kotlin and I hope to improve in it.</string>
